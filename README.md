# Maze
Reinforcement learning agents trying to get out of a maze !

## Getting started
To install the libraries needed:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the maze solver
You just need to run the main.py file
```
python main.py
```
After some warnings from Tensorflow, you will see the updated maze after each steps on the output.

You will also have a file render.txt in the render folder that give you a resume of each episode played.
